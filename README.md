# Photonic-Crystal-Fiber
The field of photonics has witnessed significant advancements in recent decades, marked by 
numerous breakthroughs and innovations. A pivotal component of photonics, photonic crystal 
fiber (PCF), has garnered considerable attention for its ability to confine light within a narrow 
range and manipulate its characteristics. This thesis focuses on the optical properties of D-Shape 
photonic crystal fibers, which have emerged as a prominent area of research due to their 
compatibility with conventional optical fibers and versatility in supporting various modes. 
 
However, accurately determining the optical properties of D-Shape PCFs presents challenges 
owing to their intricate geometry and material composition. To address this, we propose a machine 
learning-based model aimed at predicting the optical properties of D-Shape photonic crystal fibers. 
Our methodology entails training machine learning models using a dataset of simulated optical 
properties, enabling accurate predictions for new fibers.

Additionally, traditional numerical methods like the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) 
method and beam propagation method are employed to compute PCF optical properties. However, 
these methods, while accurate, are often computationally intensive and time-consuming, 
particularly for PCFs with complex geometries. 

 it introduces a groundbreaking ML methodology tailored specifically for computing the 
optical properties of D-shape PCFs. This novel approach surpasses traditional numerical methods 
in terms of both speed and accuracy. Leveraging a curated dataset of simulated optical properties, 
the ML model, powered by a neural network algorithm, discerns intricate relationships between 
input data and the optical characteristics of D-shape PCFs. The implications are profound, offering 
a streamlined path for designing and optimizing D-shape PCFs for a multitude of applications, 
spanning from fiber-optic communication to sensing and laser technology.
