# Photonic-Crystal-Fiber
The field of photonics has witnessed significant advancements in recent decades, marked by 
numerous breakthroughs and innovations. A pivotal component of photonics, photonic crystal 
fiber (PCF), has garnered considerable attention for its ability to confine light within a narrow 
range and manipulate its characteristics. This thesis focuses on the optical properties of D-Shape 
photonic crystal fibers, which have emerged as a prominent area of research due to their 
compatibility with conventional optical fibers and versatility in supporting various modes. 
 
However, accurately determining the optical properties of D-Shape PCFs presents challenges 
owing to their intricate geometry and material composition. To address this, we propose a machine 
learning-based model aimed at predicting the optical properties of D-Shape photonic crystal fibers. 
Our methodology entails training machine learning models using a dataset of simulated optical 
properties, enabling accurate predictions for new fibers.

Additionally, traditional numerical methods like the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) 
method and beam propagation method are employed to compute PCF optical properties. However, 
these methods, while accurate, are often computationally intensive and time-consuming, 
particularly for PCFs with complex geometries.
